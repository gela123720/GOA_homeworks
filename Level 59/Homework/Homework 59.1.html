            <div><p>Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program and play games created by themselves or other users.<br> It was created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004, and released to the public in 2006. As of February 2025, the platform has reported an average of 85.<br>3 million daily active users. According to the company, their monthly player base includes half of all American children under the age of 16.<br>
            The platform hosts millions of user-created games (officially referred to as "experiences"), all created using a dialect of the programming language Lua and the platform's game engine, Roblox Studio.<br> While Roblox is free-to-play, it features in-game purchases done through its virtual currency known as Robux, and game developers on the platform are able to create items that cost Robux.<br> Furthermore, the platform hosts a large virtual economy centered around those items and Robux. Using the platform's "Developer Exchange" program, creators on the platform are able to exchange their earned Robux for real-world currency.<br> The platform has also been used to host virtual concerts and events, as well as advergames.</p></div> <br> <br>
