        <h1>War</h1>
            <p>War is an armed conflict[a] between the armed forces of states, or between governmental forces <br> and armed groups that are organized under a certain command structure and have the capacity to sustain military operations, or between such organized groups.<br>
            It is generally characterized by widespread violence, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces.<br> Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general.<br>
            Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets,<br> and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties.</p>

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>The English word war derives from the 11th-century Old English words wyrre and werre,<br> from Old French werre (guerre as in modern French), in turn from the Frankish *werra, ultimately deriving from the Proto-Germanic *werz≈ç 'mixture, confusion'.<br> The word is related to the Old Saxon werran, Old High German werran, and the modern German verwirren,<br> meaning 'to confuse, to perplex, to bring into confusion'.</p> <br> <br> <br>
