                    <a id = "history of unity"></a>

                        <p>The Unity game engine launched in 2005, aiming to "democratize" game development by making it accessible to more developers.<br>
                             It was shown at Worldwide Developers Conference 2005 by Scott Forstall on Mac OS X.[11] The next year,<br>
                              Unity was named runner-up in the Best Use of Mac OS X Graphics category in Apple Inc.'s Apple Design Awards.<br>
                               Unity was initially released for Mac OS X, later adding support for Microsoft Windows and Web browsers.[13]</p>

                            <p>Unity gives users the ability to create games and experiences in both 2D and 3D,<br>
                                 and the engine offers a primary scripting API in C# using Mono, for both the Unity editor in the form of plugins,<br>
                                  and games themselves, as well as drag and drop functionality.[55] Prior to C# being the primary programming language used for the engine,<br>
                                   it previously supported Boo, which was removed with the release of Unity 5,[56]<br>
                                    and a Boo-based implementation of JavaScript called UnityScript, which was deprecated in August 2017,<br>
                                     after the release of Unity 2017.1, in favor of C#.[57][58]</p>
