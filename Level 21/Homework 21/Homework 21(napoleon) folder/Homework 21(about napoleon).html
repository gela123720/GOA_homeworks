        <h1>about Napoleon Bonaparte</h1>
            <p>Napoleon Bonaparte[b] (born Napoleone Buonaparte;[1][c] 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal name Napoleon I,<br>
                 was a French general and statesman who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led a series of military campaigns across Europe during<br>
                  the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars from 1796 to 1815. He led the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804,<br>
                   then ruled the French Empire as Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1814, and briefly again in 1815.<br>
                    He was King of Italy from 1805 to 1814 and Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine from 1806 to 1813.<br>
                    Napoleon is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history, and Napoleonic tactics are still studied at military schools worldwide.<br>
                     His legacy endures through the modernizing legal and administrative reforms he enacted in France and Western Europe, embodied in the Napoleonic Code.<br>
                      He established a system of public education,[2] abolished the vestiges of feudalism,[3] emancipated Jews and other religious minorities,<br>
                       abolished the Spanish Inquisition,[5] enacted the principle of equality before the law for an emerging middle class,<br>
                        and centralized state power at the expense of religious authorities.[7] His conquests acted as a catalyst for political change and the development<br>
                         of nation states. However, he is controversial because of his role in wars which devastated Europe, his looting of conquered territories,<br>
                          and his mixed record on civil rights. He abolished the free press, ended directly elected representative government,<br>
                           exiled and jailed critics of his regime, reinstated slavery in France's colonies except for Haiti, banned the entry of blacks and mulattos into France,<br>
                            reduced the civil rights of women and children in France, reintroduced a hereditary monarchy and nobility,<br>
                             and violently repressed popular uprisings against his rule.[11]</p>

                <h2>napoleons early life</h2>
                    <p>Napoleon's family was of Italian origin. His paternal ancestors, the Buonapartes, descended from a minor Tuscan noble family who emigrated to Corsica<br>
                         in the 16th century. His maternal ancestors, the Ramolinos, descended from a noble family from Lombardy.[12] Napoleon's parents,<br>
                          Carlo Maria Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino, lived in the Maison Bonaparte home in Ajaccio, where Napoleon was born on 15 August 1769.<br>
                           He had an elder brother Joseph and six younger siblings: Lucien, Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline, and Jérôme.[13]<br>
                            Five more siblings were stillborn or did not survive infancy.[14] Napoleon was baptized as a Catholic under the name Napoleone di Buonaparte.<br>
                             In his youth, his name was also spelled as Nabulione, Nabulio, Napolionne, and Napulione.[15]</p>

                <h2>napoleons early career</h2>
                    <p>Upon graduating in September 1785, Bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in La Fère artillery regiment.<br>
                         He served in Valence and Auxonne until after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 but spent long periods of leave in Corsica which fed<br>
                          his Corsican nationalism. In September 1789, he returned to Corsica and promoted the French revolutionary cause.<br>
                           Paoli returned to the island in July 1790, but he had no sympathy for Bonaparte, as he deemed his father a traitor<br>
                            for having deserted the cause of Corsican independence.[41][42]</p>
