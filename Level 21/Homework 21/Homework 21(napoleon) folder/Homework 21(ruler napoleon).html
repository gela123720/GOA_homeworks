            <h2>18 Brumaire</h2>
                <p>Unknown to Bonaparte, the Directory had sent him orders to return from Egypt with his army to ward off a possible invasion of France,<br>
                     but these messages never arrived.[109] By the time he reached Paris in October, France's situation had been improved by a series of victories.<br>
                    The republic, however, was bankrupt and the ineffective Directory was unpopular.[112] Despite the failures in Egypt, Bonaparte returned to a hero's welcome.<br>
                    The Directory discussed Bonaparte's desertion but was too weak to punish him.[109]Bonaparte formed an alliance with Talleyrand and leading members<br>
                    of the Council of Five Hundred and Directory—Lucien Bonaparte, Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, Roger Ducos and Joseph Fouché—to overthrow the government.<br>
                     On 9 November 1799 (18 Brumaire according to the revolutionary calendar), the conspirators launched a coup and the following day,<br>
                    backed by grenadiers with fixed bayonets, forced the Council of Five Hundred to dissolve the Directory and appoint Bonaparte,<br>
                    Sieyès and Ducos provisional consuls.</p>

                <p>On 15 December, Bonaparte introduced the Constitution of the Year VIII, under which three consuls were appointed for 10 years.<br>
                     Real power lay with Bonaparte as first consul, and his preferred candidates Cambacérès and Charles-François Lebrun were appointed as second and third<br>
                      consuls who only had an advisory role. The constitution also established a Legislative Body and Tribunate which were selected from indirectly elected<br>
                       candidates, and a Senate and Council of State which were effectively nominated by the executive.<br>
                        The constitution was approved by plebiscite on 7 February 1800. The official count was over three million in favour and 1,562 against.<br>
                         Lucien, however, had doubled the count of the "yes" vote to give the false impression that a majority<br>
                          of those eligible to vote had approved the constitution.</p>

                <p>In February 1804, Bonaparte's police made a series of arrests in relation to a royalist plot to kidnap or assassinate him that involved the British<br>
                    government, Moreau and an unnamed Bourbon prince. On the advice of his foreign minister, Talleyrand,<br>
                    Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating the sovereignty of Baden. The duke was quickly executed after a secret military<br>
                    trial, even though there was no proof he had been involved in the plot. Enghien's kidnapping and execution infuriated royalists and monarchs<br>
                    throughout Europe and drew a formal protest from Russia.Following the royalist plot, Bonaparte's supporters convinced him that creating a hereditary regime<br>
                    would help secure it in case of his death, make it more acceptable to constitutional monarchists, and put it on the same footing as other European<br>
                    monarchies.[156][157][158] On 18 May, the senate proclaimed Napoleon Emperor of the French and approved a new constitution. The following day,<br>
                    Napoleon appointed 18 of his leading generals Marshals of the Empire.</p>
