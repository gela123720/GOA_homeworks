        <h1>about CSS</h1>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML.<br>
                CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3]<br>
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility,<br>
                since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation<br>
                characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,<br>
                which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages<br>
                that share the file and its formatting.Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles<br>
                 for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.<br>
                  CSS also has rules for alternative formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[5]</p>

            <h2>Syntax</h2>
                <p>CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.A style sheet consists of a list of rules.<br>
                     Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies<br>
                      to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.</p>

                      <h4>Selector types</h4>
                        <p>Selectors may apply to the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
                                <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash prefix e.g.</li>
                                        <li>class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefix e.g.<br>
                                             .classname (the phrase "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element classes—specified with the HTML<br>
                                              class attribute—is a markup feature that is distinct from browsers' CSS subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on<br>
                                               document styles; see RDF and microformats for the origins of the "class" system of the Web content model)</li>
                                               <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
                                    </ul>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.<br>
                                 A class may apply to any number of instances of any element. An ID may only be applied to a single element.</p>

            <h2>history</h2>
                <p>CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994.[24] At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.<br>
                     Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web<br>
                      Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[26] being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential;<br>
                       he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[27]Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard<br>
                        Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.<br>
                         One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore,<br>
                          existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style<br>
                           sheets by way of "cascading" styles.[28]As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands<br>
                            of web developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML.<br>
                             Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb,[29] made consistent site appearance difficult,<br>
                              and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were<br>
                               hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web.[25] Robert Cailliau, also of CERN,<br>
                                wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for printing,<br>
                                 screen-based presentations, and editors.[29]</p>

            <h2>Browser support</h2>
                <p>Each web browser uses a layout engine to render web pages, and support for CSS functionality is not consistent between them. Because browsers<br>
                     do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding techniques have been developed to target specific browsers with workarounds<br>
                      (commonly known as CSS hacks or CSS filters). The adoption of new functionality in CSS can be hindered by a lack of support in major browsers.<br>
                       For example, Internet Explorer was slow to add support for many CSS 3 features, which slowed the adoption of those features and damaged the browser's<br>
                        reputation among developers. Additionally, a proprietary syntax for the non-vendor-prefixed filter property was used in some versions.<br>
                         In order to ensure a consistent experience for their users, web developers often test their sites across multiple operating systems, browsers,<br>
                          and browser versions, increasing development time and complexity. Tools such as BrowserStack have been built to reduce the complexity of maintaining<br>
                           these environments.In addition to these testing tools, many sites maintain lists of browser support for specific CSS properties,<br>
                            including CanIUse and the MDN Web Docs. Additionally, CSS 3 defines feature queries, which provide an @supports directive that will allow developers<br>
                             to target browsers with support for certain functionality directly within their CSS.[66] CSS that is not supported by older browsers can<br>
                              also sometimes be patched in using JavaScript polyfills, which are pieces of JavaScript code designed to make browsers behave consistently.<br>
                               These workarounds—and the need to support fallback functionality—can add complexity to development projects, and consequently, companies<br>
                                frequently define a list of browser versions that they will and will not support.As websites adopt newer code standards that are incompatible<br>
                                 with older browsers, these browsers can be cut off from accessing many of the resources on the web (sometimes intentionally).<br>
                                  Many of the most popular sites on the internet are not just visually degraded on older browsers due to poor CSS support but do not work at all,<br>
                                   in large part due to the evolution of JavaScript and other web technologies.</p>
