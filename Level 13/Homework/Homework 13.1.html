    <h1>Lua (Programming Language)</h1>
    <p><b>Lua</b> ( from Portuguese: lua meaning moon) is a lightweight,<br>
        high-level, multi-paradigm <i>Programming Language</i> designed mainly for embedded use in applications.<br>
        Lua is cross-platform software, since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C,<br>
        and Lua has a relatively simple C application programming interface <u>(API)</u> to embed it into applications.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Lua was created in <i>1993</i> by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo and Waldemar Celes,<br>
        members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group (Tecgraf) at the Pontifical Catholic University of <b>Rio De
            Janiero</b>,<br>
        in Brazil.From 1977 until 1992, Brazil had a policy of strong trade barriers (called a market reserve) for
        computer hardware and software,<br>
        believing that Brazil could and should produce its own hardware and software.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>Lua is commonly described as a "multi-paradigm" language, providing a small set of general features that can be
        extended to fit different problem<br>
        types. Lua does not contain explicit support for inheritance, but allows it to be implemented with
        metatables.<br>
        Similarly, <u>Lua</u> allows programmers to implement namespaces, classes and other related features using its
        single table implementation;<br>
        first-class functions allow the employment of many techniques from functional programming and full lexical
        scoping allows<br>
        fine-grained information hiding to enforce the principle of least privilege.</p>
