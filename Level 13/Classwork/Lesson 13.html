        <h1>Lion</h1>
            <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head;<br>
                 round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.<br>
                  It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.<br>
                   Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.</p>

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>The English word lion is derived via Anglo-Norman liun from Latin leōnem (nominative: leō), which in turn was a borrowing from Ancient Greek λέων léōn.<br>
                     The Hebrew word לָבִיא lavi may also be related.[4] The generic name Panthera is traceable<br>
                      to the classical Latin word 'panthēra' and the ancient Greek word πάνθηρ 'panther'.</p>


            <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
                <p>Felis leo was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the lion in his work Systema Naturae.<br>
                     The genus name Panthera was coined by Lorenz Oken in 1816.<br>
                      Between the mid-18th and mid-20th centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were recognised as valid in 2005.<br>
                       They were distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and skins.[11]</p>

                
                <h3>Subspecies</h3>
                    <p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, several lion type specimens were described and proposed as subspecies,<br>
                         with about a dozen recognised as valid taxa until 2017.[1] Between 2008 and 2016, IUCN Red List assessors used only two subspecific names:<br>
                          P. l. leo for African lion populations, and P. l. persica for the Asiatic lion population.<br>
                           In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group revised lion taxonomy,<br>
                            and recognises two subspecies based on results of several phylogeographic studies on lion evolution</p>

                <h3>Evolution</h3>
                    <p>The Panthera lineage is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the Felidae around 9.32 to 4.47 million years ago to 11.75<br>
                         to 0.97 million years ago.[6][32][33] Results of analyses differ in the phylogenetic relationship of the lion;<br>
                          it was thought to form a sister group with the jaguar that diverged 3.46 to 1.22 million years ago,<br>
                           but also with the leopard that diverged 3.1 to 1.95 million years ago[8][9] to 4.32 to 0.02 million years ago.</p>
