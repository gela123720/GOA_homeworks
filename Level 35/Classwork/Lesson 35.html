            <p style = "background-color: rgb(217, 255, 0); width: 300; color: rgb(0, 255, 221);">Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. <br>

                Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and <br>functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. <br>

                Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language, and he first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was <br> released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the  last release of Python 2. <br>

                Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and it has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.

            <h2>History</h2>
                <p style = "background-color: red; width: 300; color: green;">Python was conceived in the late 1980s[42] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands; it was conceived as a successor to the ABC    <br> programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[43] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[12] Python implementation began in <br> December, 1989.[44] Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from <br> responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the <br> project's chief decision-maker.[45] (He has since come out of retirement and is self-titled "BDFL-emeritus".) In January, 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[46][47]</p>

            <h2>Design philosophy and features</h2>
                <p style = "background-color: rgb(255, 0, 191); width: 300; color: rgb(8, 42, 80);">Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional <br> programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming[75] and metaobjects).[76] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by <br> contract[77][78] and logic programming.[79] Python is often referred to as a 'glue language'[80] because it can seamlessly integrate components written in other languages.</p>
