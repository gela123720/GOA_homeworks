<h1>Cat</h1>

<p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal.<br>
It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae.<br>
Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat,<br>
but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin.<br>
Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes,<br>
and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.</p>

<h2>Etymology and naming</h2>

<p>The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.[4]<br>
The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African language.[5]<br>
The Nubian word kaddîska wildcat and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[6]<br>
The forms might also have derived from an ancient Germanic word that was absorbed into Latin and then into Greek, Syriac, and Arabic.[7]<br>
The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf.<br>
Northern Sámi gáđfi, female stoat, and Hungarian hölgy, lady, female stoat; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, female (of a furred animal).[8]</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

<p>The scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat.[1][2]<br>
Felis catus domesticus was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777.[3]<br>
Felis daemon proposed by Konstantin Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat.[19][20]<br>
In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct species, namely Felis catus.[21][22]<br>
In 2007, the modern domesticated subspecies F. silvestris catus sampled worldwide was considered to have probably descended from the African wildcat (F. lybica),<br>
following results of phylogenetic research.[23][24][a] In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce followed the recommendation of the ICZN in regarding the domestic cat<br>
as a distinct species, Felis catus.[25]</p>

<h2>Evolution</h2>

<p>The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that has a common ancestor from about 10 to 15 million years ago.[26]<br>
The evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia during the Miocene around 8.38 to 14.45 million years ago.[27]<br>
Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at 6.46 to 16.76 million years ago.[28]<br>
The genus Felis genetically diverged from other Felidae around 6 to 7 million years ago.[27]<br>
Results of phylogenetic research shows that the wild members of this genus evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation,<br>
whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.[29] The domestic cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes[30]<br>
and roughly 20,000 genes.[31]</p>
