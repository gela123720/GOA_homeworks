<h1>C++ Wikipedia</h1>

<p>C++ (/ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/, pronounced "C plus plus" and sometimes abbreviated as CPP) is a high-level,<br>
general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup.<br>
First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time;<br>
as of 1997, C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation for systems like<br>
microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows. It is usually implemented as a compiled language,<br>
and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.[14]</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++.[29]<br>
The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. <br>
Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use,<br>
while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs,<br>
he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his PhD experience, <br>
Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features.[30] C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable,<br>
and widely used. In addition to C and Simula's influences, other languages influenced this new language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU, and ML.</p>

<h3>Standardization</h3>

<p>C++ is standardized by an ISO working group known as JTC1/SC22/WG21. So far, it has published seven revisions of the C++ standard and is currently working<br>
on the next revision, C++26.<br>
Scene during the C++ standards committee meeting in Stockholm in 1996<br>
In 1998, the ISO working group standardized C++ for the first time as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which is informally known as C++98. In 2003,<br>
it published a new version of the C++ standard called ISO/IEC 14882:2003, which fixed problems identified in C++98.</p>

<h2>standart library</h2>

<p>The C++ standard consists of two parts: the core language and the standard library. C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++;<br>
it includes aggregate types (vectors, lists, maps, sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples), algorithms (find, for_each, binary_search, random_shuffle, etc.),<br>
input/output facilities (iostream, for reading from and writing to the console and files), filesystem library, localisation support,<br>
smart pointers for automatic memory management, regular expression support, multi-threading library, atomics support <br>
(allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time utilities <br>
(measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that does not use C++ exceptions into C++ exceptions, <br>
a random number generator, and a slightly modified version of the C standard library (to make it comply with the C++ type system).</p>
