<h1>JavaScript</h1>

<p>often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
 Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]
Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code.
These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps.
The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11]
 
It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
 It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

 The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.
 In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<h3>Creation at Netscape</h3>

<p>The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993.
Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web.[12]
The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994.
This quickly became the most-used.[13]During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser.
There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator.
They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]</p>

<h3>Adoption by Microsoft</h3>

<p>Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft created its own interpreter called JScript.[18]
Microsoft first released JScript in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML.
Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Netscape Navigator.[19][20]
These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers,
leading to widespread use of "best viewed in Netscape" and "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several years.[19][21]</p>

<h2>TradeMark</h2>

<p>"JavaScript" is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States.[37][38]
The trademark was originally issued to Sun Microsystems on 6 May 1997, and was transferred to Oracle when they acquired Sun in 2009.[39][40]
A letter was circulated in September 2024, spearheaded by Ryan Dahl, calling on Oracle to free the JavaScript trademark.[41]
Brendan Eich, the original creator of JavaScript, was among the over 14,000 signatories who supported the initiative.</p>

<h2>Website client-side usage</h2>

<p>JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose.[10]
Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.
All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.</p>

<h3>Libraries and frameworks</h3>

<p>Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework as part of their client-side scripting.[42]
jQuery is by far the most-used.[42] Other notable ones include Angular, Bootstrap, Lodash, Modernizr, React, Underscore, and Vue.[42]
Multiple options can be used in conjunction, such as jQuery and Bootstrap.[43]
However, the term "Vanilla JS" was coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.[44]</p>

<h2>Other usage</h2>

<p>The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems,
both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.
Initial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft's Internet Information Services,[45][46] but they were small niches.[47]
Server-side usage eventually started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches.[47]
Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript.
Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents[48] and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.[49]
Oracle used to provide Nashorn, a JavaScript interpreter, as part of their Java Development Kit (JDK) API library along with jjs a command line interpreter as of JDK version 8.
It was removed in JDK 15. As a replacement Oracle offered GraalJS which can also be used with the OpenJDK which allows one to create and reference Java objects in JavaScript code
and add runtime scripting in JavaScript to applications written in Java.
JavaScript has been used in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.</p>
