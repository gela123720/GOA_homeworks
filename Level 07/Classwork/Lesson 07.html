<h1>Basketball</h1>

<p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each,
 opposing one another on a rectangular court,
 compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball<br> (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop
 (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m)
<br> high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting
 through their own hoop. <br> A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.<br>
 After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul
 is given one, two or three one-point free throws.<br> The team with the most points at the end of the game wins,
 but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</p>

 <h2>History</h2>

 <h3>Early History</h3>

 <p>A game similar to basketball is mentioned in a 1591 book published in Frankfurt am Main that reports on the lifestyles and customs of coastal North American residents,<br>
 Wahrhafftige Abconterfaytung der Wilden (German; translates as Truthful Depictions of the Savages:[5] "Among other things,<br>
 a game of skill is described in which balls must be thrown against a target woven from twigs, mounted high on a pole.<br>
 There's a small reward for the player if the target is being hit."[6]</p>

<h3>Creation</h3>

<p>In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian-American professor of physical education and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School<br>
 (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts,[7] was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day.[8]<br>
 He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters.<br>
 After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums,<br>
 he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall.<br>
 Naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track. Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact,<br>
 which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored. This quickly proved tedious,<br>
 so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored basket.</p>

 <h3>College basketball</h3>

 <p>Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States,<br>
 and it quickly spread through the United States and Canada. By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools.<br>
 While YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the new sport,<br>
 as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from YMCA's primary mission. However, other amateur sports clubs, colleges,<br>
 and professional clubs quickly filled the void.</p>

 <h2>Rules and regulations</h2>

 <p>Measurements and time limits discussed in this section often vary among tournaments and organizations;<br>
 international and NBA rules are used in this section.</p>

 <h3>Playing Regulations</h3>

 <p>Games are played in four quarters of 10 (FIBA)[43] or 12 minutes (NBA).<br>
[44] College men's games use two 20-minute halves,[45] college women's games use 10-minute quarters,[46]<br>
 and most United States high school varsity games use 8-minute quarters; however, this varies from state to state</p>

 <h3>equipment</h3>

 <p>The only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court: a flat, rectangular surface with baskets at opposite ends.<br>
 Competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks, score sheets, scoreboards, alternating possession arrows,<br>
 and whistle-operated stop-clock systems.</p>

 <h3>Violations</h3>

 <p>The ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the ball while running).<br>
The ball must stay within the court; the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession.<br>
 The ball is out of bounds if it touches a boundary line, or touches any player or object that is out of bounds.</p>
