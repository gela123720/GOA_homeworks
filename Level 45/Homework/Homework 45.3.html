                <p class = "paragraphs">Nokia's history dates from 1865, when mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill <br> on the shores of the Tammerkoski rapids near the town of Tampere, Finland (then a Grand Duchy under Russian Empire's rule).<br> A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia, where there were better hydropower resources.[6] In 1871, Idestam, together with a friend Leo Mechelin,<br> formed a shared company and called it Nokia Ab (in Swedish, Nokia Company being the English equivalent), after the site of the second pulp mill.</p>
