            <p id = "p3">History</p>
            <p id = "p4">Our Shop was first opened in 1999, 19th october. when we opened no one was coming by to visit us, but after one customer came by and bought one of our cars, he liked it so much that he told everyone he knew that the car was very good so the popularity of our store rocketed up, we were working harder and harder to satisfy our customers and we were picking up great employees with experience and knowledge, now we are one of the most popular car shops in the country.</p>

            <p id = "p5">Car Policy</p>
            <p id = "p6">We dont take any refund, even though its very unlikely you wont like our cars, its still possible and we are not liable for anything that happens to your car that you bought from us, so dont ask and dont try to get a refund, its useless and you will only waste our and your time. by refund we lose money and if we were giving out refunds left and right then we would go bankrupt. also we are not liable for any damages of any kind to your bought car since its not your property.</p>
