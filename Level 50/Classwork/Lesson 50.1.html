        <h1>Wreck It Raplh!</h1>
            <p>Wreck-It Ralph is a 2012 American animated comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. <br> It was directed by Rich Moore and produced by Clark Spencer, from a screenplay by Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee.<br> John Lasseter served as the film's executive producer. Featuring the voices of John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, and Jane Lynch, the film tells the story of Ralph,<br> an arcade game villain who rebels against his "bad guy" role and dreams of becoming a hero.<br>
            The concept of Wreck-It Ralph originated in the late 1980s under the working title High Score and evolved through various iterations.<br> Moore sought to capture an authentic video-game world by including real video game characters like Bowser, Clyde,<br> and Doctor Eggman, while focusing on creating new characters. For animation, Disney introduced new reflectance functions and a real-time virtual camera system.<br> The team researched candy factories and food photography to inspire the design of the Sugar Rush game world. Henry Jackman composed the score,<br> and the soundtrack featured songs by Owl City, AKB48, and Skrillex, among others.<br>
            Wreck-It Ralph premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on October 29, 2012,[6]<br> and went into general release on November 2. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $496 million<br> worldwide against a $165 million budget and winning the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature, as well as receiving nominations<br> for the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.<br> A sequel, Ralph Breaks the Internet, was released in 2018.</p>
