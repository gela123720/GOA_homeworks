        <h1>Mahed potato</h1>
            <p>Mashed potato or mashed potatoes (American, Canadian, and Australian English), colloquially known as mash (British English),<br> is a dish made by mashing boiled or steamed potatoes, usually with added milk, butter, salt, and pepper.<br> It is generally served as a side dish to meat or vegetables. Roughly mashed potatoes are sometimes called smashed potatoes.<br> Dehydrated instant mashed potatoes[3] and frozen mashed potatoes[4] are available. Mashed potatoes are an ingredient in other dishes, such as dumplings and gnocchi.</p>

            <h2>ingredients</h2>
                <p>Most authors recommend the use of "floury" potatoes with a high ratio of amylose in their starch to achieve a fluffy, creamy consistency and appearance.<br> The best-known floury varieties are King Edward, Golden Wonder, and Red Rascal in Britain and the Russet in North America.<br> However, some recipes use "waxy" potatoes containing more amylopectin in their starch for a different texture or look;<br> for instance, one pounded mashed potato dish from Yunnan cuisine (in southwestern China), uses waxy potatoes to achieve a chewy, sticky texture.<br>
                Butter, milk or cream, salt, and pepper are usually added. Many other seasonings may also be used, including herbs (notably parsley and chives),<br> spices (notably nutmeg), garlic, cheese, bacon, sour cream, crisp onion or spring onion, caramelized onion, and mustard.<br>
                One French variation adds egg yolk for pommes duchesse, or Duchess potatoes, piped through a carrot tube into wavy ribbons and rosettes, brushed with butter, and lightly browned.<br> Some French recipes for pomme purée (potato puree) use up to one part butter for every two parts potato.<br> In low-calorie or non-dairy variations, milk, cream, and butter may be replaced by soup stock or broth.<br>
                Aloo bharta, an Indian sub-continent variation, uses chopped onions, mustard (oil, paste, or seeds), chili pepper, coriander leaves, and other spices.<br> Alu pitika (Assamese: আলু পিটিকা) is a popular variation of aloo bharta in Assam,[16][17] that may occasionally omit mustard and other spices.<br> Alu pitika, made with roasted and smoked potatoes, is especially consumed in the winter.</p>
