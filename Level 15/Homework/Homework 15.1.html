        <h1>Basketball</h1>
            <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">basketball</a> is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court,<br>
                 compete with the primary objective of shooting a <u>Basketball</u> (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop<br>
                  (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court),<br>
                   while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line,<br>
                    when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one,<br>
                     two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied,<br>
                      an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</p>

                <h3>Early History</h3>
                    <p>Early history
                        A game similar to basketball is mentioned in a 1591 book published in <b>Frankfurt</b> am Main that reports on the lifestyles<br>
                         and customs of coastal <em>North American residents</em>, Wahrhafftige Abconterfaytung der Wilden<br>
                          (German; translates as Truthful Depictions of the Savages.) "Among other things,<br>
                           a game of skill is described in which balls must be thrown against a target woven from twigs, mounted high on a pole.<br>
                            There's a small reward for the player if the target is being hit."[6]</p>

                <h3>Creation</h3>
                    <p>In December 1891, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Naismith">James Naismith</a>, a Canadian-American professor of <i>physical education</i> and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian<br>
                         Association Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts,[7] was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day.[8]<br>
                          He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long <strong>New England</strong> winters.<br>
                           After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball<br>
                            to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall.</p>
