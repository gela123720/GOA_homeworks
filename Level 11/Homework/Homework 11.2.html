        <h1>Outer Space</h1>
            <p>Outer space (or simply space) is the expanse that exists beyond Earth's atmosphere and between celestial bodies.<br>
                 It contains ultra-low levels of particle densities, constituting a near-perfect vacuum of predominantly hydrogen and helium plasma,<br>
                  permeated by electromagnetic radiation, cosmic rays, neutrinos, magnetic fields and dust.<br>
                   The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins (−270 °C; −455 °F).<br>
            The plasma between galaxies is thought to account for about half of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe,<br>
             having a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a kinetic temperature of millions of kelvins.<br>
              Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe,<br>
               but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space. Most of the remaining mass-energy in the observable universe is made up of an unknown<br>
                form, dubbed dark matter and dark energy.</p>

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>The use of the short version space, as meaning "the region beyond Earth's sky", predates the use of full term "outer space",<br>
                 with the earliest recorded use of this meaning in an epic poem by John Milton called Paradise Lost, published in 1667.<br>
                 ]The term outward space existed in a poem from 1842 by the English poet Lady Emmeline Stuart-Wortley called "The Maiden of Moscow",<br>
                  but in astronomy the term outer space found its application for the first time in 1845 by Alexander von Humboldt.<br>
                   The term was eventually popularized through the writings of H. G. Wells after 1901.<br>
                    Theodore von Kármán used the term of free space to name the space of altitudes above Earth where spacecrafts reach conditions sufficiently free from atmospheric<br>
                     drag, differentiating it from airspace, identifying a legal space above territories free from the sovereign jurisdiction of countries.<br>
                     "Spaceborne" denotes existing in outer space, especially if carried by a spacecraft; similarly, "space-based" means based in outer space or on a planet or moon.</p>


        <h2>Formation and state</h2>
            <p>The size of the whole universe is unknown, and it might be infinite in extent.[19] According to the Big Bang theory, the very early universe was an extremely<br>
                 hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago which rapidly expanded.<br>
                  About 380,000 years later the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch.<br>
                   When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space.<br>
                    Matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects,<br>
                     leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space.<br>
                      As light has a finite velocity, this theory constrains the size of the directly observable universe.</p>

        <h2>Environment</h2>
            <p>Outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets,<br>
                 and moons to move freely along their orbits. The deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter.<br>
                  By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter.<br>
                   The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered:<br>
                    the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023 km, or 10 billion light years.<br>
                     In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas,<br>
                      is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.</p>

        <h2>Human access</h2>
            <h3>Effect on biology and human bodies</h3>
                <p>Despite the harsh environment, several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods.<br>
                     Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007.<br>
                      Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years.<br>
                       A strain of Bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low Earth orbit or a simulated Martian environment.<br>
                        The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another<br>
                         habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the Solar System,<br>
                          with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.</p>

                            <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Bruce_McCandless_II_during_EVA_in_1984.jpg/170px-Bruce_McCandless_II_during_EVA_in_1984.jpg" width = "150px">

                <h4>Vacuum</h4>
                    <p>The lack of pressure in space is the most immediate dangerous characteristic of space to humans.<br>
                         Pressure decreases above Earth, reaching a level at an altitude of around 19.14 km (11.89 mi) that matches the vapor pressure of water at the<br>
                          temperature of the human body. This pressure level is called the Armstrong line, named after American physician Harry G. Armstrong.<br>
                           At or above the Armstrong line, fluids in the throat and lungs boil away. More specifically, exposed bodily liquids such as saliva, tears,<br>
                            and liquids in the lungs boil away. Hence, at this altitude, human survival requires a pressure suit, or a pressurized capsule.<br>
                             Out in space, sudden exposure of an unprotected human to very low pressure, such as during a rapid decompression, can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a<br>
                              rupture of the lungs, due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest.<br>
                               Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture.<br>
                                Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues,<br>
                                 and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia.</p>

                
                <h4>Weightlessness and radiation</h4>
                    <p>Humans evolved for life in Earth gravity, and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health.<br>
                         Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy,<br>
                          and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment.<br>
                           Longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia.<br>
                            These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise.<br>
                             Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders,<br>
                              and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.</p>



                              <h3>Boundary</h3>
                                <p>The transition between Earth's atmosphere and outer space lacks a well-defined physical boundary, with the air pressure steadily decreasing<br>
                                     with altitude until it mixes with the solar wind. Various definitions for a practical boundary have been proposed,<br>
                                      ranging from 30 km (19 mi) out to 1,600,000 km (990,000 mi).<br>
                                       In 2009, measurements of the direction and speed of ions in the atmosphere were made from a sounding rocket. The altitude of 118 km<br>
                                        (73.3 mi) above Earth was the midpoint for charged particles transitioning from the gentle winds of the Earth's atmosphere to the more<br>
                                         extreme flows of outer space. The latter can reach velocities well over 268 m/s (880 ft/s).High-altitude aircraft,<br>
                                          such as high-altitude balloons have reached altitudes above Earth of up to 50 km. Up until 2021,<br>
                                           the United States designated people who travel above an altitude of 50 mi (80 km) as astronauts.<br>
                                            Astronaut wings are now only awarded to spacecraft crew members that "demonstrated activities during flight that were essential<br>
                                             to public safety, or contributed to human space flight safety".</p>
