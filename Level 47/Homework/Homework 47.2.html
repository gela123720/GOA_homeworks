                    <p class = "paragraphs">In 1938, during the Japanese era, Lee Byung-chul (1910–1987), a member of a large landowning family <br> in Ginei moved to nearby Taikyu and founded Mitsuboshi Trading Company (株式会社三星商会 (Kabushiki gaisha Mitsuboshi Shōkai)), <br>or Samsung Sanghoe (주식회사 삼성상회). Samsung started out as a small trading company with forty employees located in Su-dong (now Ingyo-dong).[15] <br> It dealt in dried fish,[15] locally-grown groceries and noodles.[16] The company prospered and Lee moved its head office to Seoul in 1947. <br> When the Korean War broke out, he was forced to leave Seoul. He started a sugar refinery in Pusan named Cheil Jedang. In 1954, <br>Lee founded Cheil Mojik, a textiles company, and built the first plant in Chimsan-dong, Taegu. <br>It was the largest woollen mill in the country at the time of construction.[17]</p> <br>
